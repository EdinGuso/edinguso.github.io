title: "Computer Networks Term Project"
excerpt: "We developed a file transfer client and server application in C#. The client can upload and download files, make the files public or private, make copies on the server, request a list of all files and access other people's public files. Server can handle multiple client connections at a time. We extensively used the Socket and Threading libraries.\n\n
