**Introduction:** In this project I have worked on the motion of a flying robot. The flying robot is a quadrotor and as it can be understood from the name, it has 4 motors with propellers attached to them. I had two different control tasks in this project. One of them was to make the quadrotor fly upwards and hover, while the second one was controlling the quadrotor in any direction given. In order to do those tasks, I modelled the quadrotor's dynamics in Simulink and designed two different control algorithms for each task. These algorithms are obviously very different from each other. Therefore, most of the sections in this report will be divided into two parts. Implementation, difficulties, assumptions and results of both of the control algorithms will be discussed in detail in the following parts of the report.
