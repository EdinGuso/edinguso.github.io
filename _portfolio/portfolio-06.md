**Abstract:** Infectious and parasitic diseases are difficult to distinguish when the medical equipment is limited. Late detection of these diseases may cause an outbreak and endanger many lives. In collaboration with iGH lab and MSF, we built an unsupervised machine learning model to cluster the patient data to help detect potential outbreaks and their characteristics and a Power BI dashboard for visualization of data and the model.
