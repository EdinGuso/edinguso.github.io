Hi! I am Edin Guso. I am a second year Computer Science MSc. student at [EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/en/). I am doing my specialization in Computer Science Theory.

I recieved a BSc. in Computer Science and BSc. in Mechatronics Engineering (double major) from [Sabanci University](https://www.sabanciuniv.edu/en/) in 2021.

Broadly, I am interested in theoretical computer science and algorithm design. I am looking forward to research opportunities in related fields.
