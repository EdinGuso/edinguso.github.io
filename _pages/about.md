Hi! I am Edin Guso. I am a Computer Science MSc. student at [EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/en/). I am writing my Master thesis at [Logmind](https://www.logmind.com/) as an AI & Software Engineer.

I received a BSc. in Computer Science and BSc. in Mechatronics Engineering (double major) from [Sabanci University](https://www.sabanciuniv.edu/en/) in 2021.

I am interested in a variety of topics, such as AI Engineering, Software Engineering, Distributed Algorithms and Graph Algorithms.
